      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hi, my name is Tom and I will be 25 on November 15, 2019. It's and important life changing milestone at 1/4 a century old and the beginning of a new decade. 
        I am a Texas A&M grad with a B.S. in Business management and I have been in search of a brighter and more exciting career path for a bout a year now. 
        I am currently seeking employment while taking this program and cant wait to get started coding.
         I have had an interet in computers and engineering my whole life and have been building them for over 10 years now; it's high time i learned to code too.
        I learne HTML in highschool along with photoshop, after effects, premier pro and cinemetoghraphy, hopefully that experience helps with the bootcamp.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Houston Texas and grew up in Sealy Texas about 40 minutes west of Houston from age 5 to 18. I have high hopes of moving west to Austin in the years to come.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Staying active; mosly by going to the gym. 
        Playing Video Games on Xbox, PS4 or PC; particuraly Call of Duty (MW2 is still the best), Forza Motorsport, Spider-Man, Horizon Zero Dawn, Assassin's Creed, Portal, and so... 
        I also play electric Guitar and love classic rock. 
        Another favorite hobby of mine is the shooting range. The applied physics of long range target shooting is rather fun.
        Finally, I love Sports cars. Audi's and ferrari's specifically. 
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job would be, being able to develop a company that really makes people lives better. wether that's though eating healtheir, getting more exercise, adopting solar energy, revolutionizing the way we learn as kids.
        Or building bridges within humanity to bring everyone to a higher level of living.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Houston, the cypress Suburb in Northwest Houston.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Because the world, thankfully, revolves around data and real scientific inquary when making decisions now. From Parents at home, students learning on YouTube, Doctors in Hospitals, Engineers at SpaceX and NASA, and even to good 
        world leaders. So the biggest way to make a difference in this connected world of ours, is to help design the programs the decision makers use.
